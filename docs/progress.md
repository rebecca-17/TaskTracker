Replace the empty whitespace with an `X` (e.g., `- [X]`, but do not include the backticks) when you have completed the requirement and you are ready to have it graded. Do not change the capitalized name, or you will not earn points. Do not remove incomplete requirements, simply leave them blank.
If you are doing your own project replace with yuor own requirements/extensions. 

# Personalized Task Tracker

Inspo: Canvas 
	I want to make a more user-friendly version of Canvas to be able to better track assignments, but I also want to include features that allow for personal goals and non academic tasks to be tracked as well.

- [X] NAME: See the authors of the game (name and UD email) visibly on the screen.
- [X] Add: Be able to add a new task
- [X] Task Details: Be able to add optional details including description or what the task is for
- [X] Different Modes: Be able to view tasks per day or month or other option for just a list view with due dates
- [X] Track: Be able to check task off list
- [X] Graphic: Optional Graphic appear that shows amount of completed tasks for the week
- [X] Remove: Be able to remove a task

Possible extension requirements (optional):

- [ ] Repetition: Have some tasks repeat weekly or repeat somehow
- [ ] Prioiritize: Add priorities for tasks and sort that way
- [ ] Animation: Animation for completing a task
- [ ] Testing

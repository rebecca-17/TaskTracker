# Task Tracker
TaskTracker is a simple web application used to keep track of your tasks and assignments for work, school, or personal life. This project was originally built for my Intro to Computer Science II class, but I've decided to continue developing it as a personal project to keep learning and improving my skills.

### Current Features:
- Add, delete, and complete tasks
- Organize tasks by categories, priorities, or due date
- Review a summary of tasks
- HTML (WebZ Framework) and CSS designs

### Getting Started:
*⚠️ Deployment to GitHub Pages is currently not working — but the app runs locally without issue.*
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/rebecca-17/TaskTracker.git
- Install dependencies: npm install
- Run the app locally: npm run start

### What I have learned:
- Familiarized myself myself with basic HTML and CSS
- Structuring a web app using components
- Using the WebZ framework for frontend development
- Utilizing GitHub for version control
